# Database

- I will try and use an sql based go framework
- I dont want to use an ORM even tho it will make my life at first easier . I will stick to the basic and implement
  the db in sql syntax

- Important the Models also have crud functions to be retrived from the databse written to and so on

- When creating a Model in the App you have to give the app the Database instance so it knows
  where and what database is used
